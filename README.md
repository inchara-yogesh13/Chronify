DESCRIPTION:
Chronify is a modern time-tracking and productivity analytics tool designed to help users understand how they spend their time online and improve their digital habits. It focuses on visual clarity, simplicity, and meaningful insights rather than overwhelming statistics.

Chronify tracks time spent across different websites and categorizes them into productive and unproductive activities. Productive websites typically include coding platforms, educational resources, and work-related tools, while unproductive websites may include social media, entertainment, or excessive browsing platforms. This classification allows users to clearly see where their time is going and how effectively it is being used.

The application presents data through a visually appealing dashboard inspired by a northern-lights (aurora) theme, using dark backgrounds with blue and cyan highlights for a modern, calming experience. The dashboard displays key metrics such as productivity score, time distribution, and website-wise breakdowns. Users can view insights in different time ranges like daily, weekly, and monthly reports, making it easier to track habits over time.

Chronify uses interactive charts and tables to show productive versus unproductive time, along with detailed website names and hours spent on each. This helps users identify distractions, optimize their workflow, and set better boundaries for digital usage. Even in its demo mode, the interface closely resembles a real-world analytics tool, making it ideal for presentations and academic evaluations.

Overall, Chronify aims to promote mindful technology use by transforming raw browsing data into actionable insights. With its clean UI, intuitive visuals, and clear productivity metrics, Chronify demonstrates how time-tracking tools can be both functional and user-friendly, encouraging better focus, discipline, and digital well-being.
